Ember CLI is the [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com) command line utility that
provides a fast [Broccoli](https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli#broccoli)-powered
asset pipeline, a strong conventional project structure, and a powerful [addon
system](http://www.ember-cli.com/extending/#developing-addons-and-blueprints)
for extension. [Get started.](/user-guide/#getting-started)

Ember CLI's [asset compilation system](https://ember-cli.com/user-guide/#asset-compilation) has support for:

* [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/)
* [HTMLBars](https://github.com/tildeio/htmlbars/)
* [Emblem](http://emblemjs.com/)
* [LESS](http://lesscss.org/)
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
* [Compass](http://compass-style.org/)
* [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/)
* [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/)
* [EmberScript](http://emberscript.com/)
* Minified JS & CSS

In addition to the above, Ember CLIâ€™s [addon
system](http://www.ember-cli.com/extending/#developing-addons-and-blueprints)
provides a way to create reusable units of code, extend the build tool, and
more. To view a complete list of addons, please visit
[emberaddons](http://www.emberaddons.com/).

### Modules

Ember CLI uses [babel](https://babeljs.io/),
which turns [ES2015 module syntax](http://jsmodules.io/)
into AMD (RequireJS-esq) modules.

Using a custom resolver, Ember CLI can automatically import modules when
needed. For example, the route in `routes/post.js` will know to use the
controller in `controllers/post.js` and the template in `templates/post.hbs`.
You are not limited to automatic resolution so if your application needs to
explicitly include a module, it's only an `import` away. Learn more about
[ES2015 modules here](http://jsmodules.io/).

### Testing using the CLI

All apps built with Ember CLI are preconfigured to use
[QUnit](http://qunitjs.com/) and [Ember
QUnit](https://github.com/rwjblue/ember-qunit). While these are the default,
you are free to use other options such as [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and
[Ember Mocha](https://github.com/switchfly/ember-cli-mocha/).

### Dependency Management

Ember CLI supports both [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and
[npm](http://npmjs.org) for managing dependencies. Ember CLI also has
optional support for [Bower](http://bower.io/).

### Runtime Configuration

Ember CLI's runtime is configurable via a file named `.ember-cli`.  The
JSON-formatted file, which must be placed in your home directory, can include
any command-line options whose names must be in camel case form. For example:

{% highlight bash %}
# ~/.ember-cli
{
  "skipGit" : true,
  "port" : 999,
  "host" : "0.1.0.1",
  "liveReload" : true,
  "environment" : "mock-development",
  "checkForUpdates" : false
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Content Security Policy

The [ember-cli-content-security-policy](https://github.com/rwjblue/ember-cli-content-security-policy/)
addon can be used to to enable the [Content Security Policy](http://content-security-policy.com/) 
headers in modern browsers when running the development server.

When enabled, Content Security Policy headers help mitigate certain types of
attacks including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection.
[Browser support](http://caniuse.com/#feat=contentsecuritypolicy) is very good, 
and the `ember-cli-content-security-policy` addon makes it easy to build your
app with CSP in mind. For example, enabling it on your production stack is
a matter of [adding headers](/user-guide/#content-security-policy). 

### Community
