### Visual Studio Code
If you are using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with `ember-cli`, there's an [official
extension pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=emberjs.emberjs#overview) 
maintained by the Ember Learning team that adds multiple ember plugins that can help in 
Ember development. If you already have VSCode installed on your machine, you can 
[click here](vscode:extension/emberjs.emberjs) to view this extension pack inside VSCode. Alternatively, you can 
also search for `emberjs.emberjs` inside the [extensions view](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery).

### Atom

If you are using [Atom](https://atom.io) with `ember-cli`, there are some
packages available specific to Ember development.

`Atom -> Preferences -> Install`

* [ember-cli-helper](https://atom.io/packages/ember-cli-helper) - ember-cli integration in Atom
* [ember-tabs](https://atom.io/packages/ember-tabs) - Makes atom.io work better with Ember pods
* [atom-ember-components](https://atom.io/packages/atom-ember-components) - See all controllers and components that are rendering your component. Currently only works with pods structure.

### Emacs

If you are using [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) with `ember-cli`,
Emacs creates temporary backup, autosave, and lockfiles that interfere with
broccoli watcher, so they need to either be moved out of the way or disabled.
To do that, ensure your emacs configuration contains the following:

{% highlight lisp %}
(setq backup-directory-alist `((".*" . ,temporary-file-directory)))
(setq auto-save-file-name-transforms `((".*" ,temporary-file-directory t)))
(setq create-lockfiles nil)
{% endhighlight %}

An [ember-mode](https://github.com/madnificent/ember-mode) package is also
available. It has shortcuts for quickly navigating files in ember projects,
running generators, and running build, serve, and test tasks. It also includes
support for linking build errors to files and minibuffer notifications of
`ember serve` status. It can be installed from [MELPA](http://melpa.org/). To
use MELPA, ensure your configuration contains the following:

{% highlight lisp %}
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)
(package-initialize)
{% endhighlight %}

Then ember-mode can be installed from the package menu at `M-x
package-list-packages`. After it is installed, add a file named
`.dir-locals.el` to the root of your ember projects with the contents:

{% highlight lisp %}
((nil . ((mode . ember))))
{% endhighlight %}

to enable it inside those projects.


### Sublime Text

If you are using [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) with `ember-cli`,
by default it will try to index all files in your `tmp` directory for its
GoToAnything functionality.  This will cause your computer to come to a
screeching halt @ 90%+ CPU usage, and can significantly increase build times.
Simply remove these directories from the folders Sublime Text watches:

`Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Settings - User`

{% highlight javascript %}
// folder_exclude_patterns and file_exclude_patterns control which files
// are listed in folders on the side bar. These can also be set on a per-
// project basis.
"folder_exclude_patterns": [".svn", ".git", ".hg", "CVS", "tmp/class-*", "tmp/es_*", "tmp/jshinter*", "tmp/replace_*", "tmp/static_compiler*", "tmp/template_compiler*", "tmp/tree_merger*", "tmp/coffee_script*", "tmp/concat-tmp*", "tmp/export_tree*", "tmp/sass_compiler*"]
{% endhighlight %}

### WebStorm
If you are using [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) with
`ember-cli`, you will need to modify your `.gitignore` file, enable
`ECMAScript6` settings, and mark certain directories.

First, add the following line to `.gitignore`:
{% highlight bash %}
.idea
{% endhighlight %}

Next, from the WebStorm menu:

`File > Settings -> Languages & Frameworks -> JavaScript -> ECMAScript6`

Click 'OK' to close the Settings modal window.

Next, in Webstorm's Project window right-click on each of the following
directories, go to 'Mark Directory As' and mark as indicated:

Mark as `Excluded`:
{% highlight bash %}
/tmp
/dist
{% endhighlight %}

Mark as `Resource Root`:
{% highlight bash %}
/
/bower_components
/bower_components/ember-qunit/lib
/public
{% endhighlight %}

Mark as `Test Sources Root`:
{% highlight bash %}
/tests
{% endhighlight %}

### Intellij-emberjs

[This plugin](https://github.com/Turbo87/intellij-emberjs) provides excellent
Ember.js support for all JetBrains IDEs that support JavaScript, including
WebStorm.

In order to install it, go to `File | Settings... | Plugins | Browse
repositories...` search for `Ember.js` and hit the Install button.

### Vim

If you are using [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) with `ember-cli`, Vim creates
temporary backups and autosaves which interfere with broccoli, so they need to
either be moved out of the way or disabled. To do that, ensure your .vimrc
contains the following:

{% highlight bash %}
set backupdir=~/.vim/backup//
set directory=~/.vim/swap//
set undodir=~/.vim/undo//
{% endhighlight %}


And make sure to create the directories- `mkdir -p ~/.vim/backup; mkdir -p ~/.vim/swap; mkdir -p ~/.vim/undo`
